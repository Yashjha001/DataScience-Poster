# DataScience-Poster
Our project predicts student dropouts in MOOCs using Logistic Regression on the OULAD dataset. After preprocessing and analysis, the model identifies Low, Medium, and High-risk learners based on engagement and performance. This helps educators apply targeted interventions like reminders or mentorship to improve student retention.
